# Quiz WebPage
Simple rules: The correct answers will be highlighted green while the wrong answers will be highlighted red.

## Future Features
I plan to implement a few features of the list in the near future:
- ~~dark mode~~
- stable mobile version
- ability to choose topic of the quiz
- ~~randomizer for an order of library's questions in quiz~~

## Technologies
Project based on:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

*I believe my solution isn't the best and code can be more optimized as well as technologies I user for this. Feel free to suggest your ideas*
